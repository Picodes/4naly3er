  description:
    "The `decimals()` function is not a part of the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), and was added later as an [optional extension](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol). As such, some valid ERC20 tokens do not support this interface, so it is unsafe to blindly cast all tokens to this interface, and then call this function.",
