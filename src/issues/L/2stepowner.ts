  description:
    'Recommend considering implementing a two step process where the owner or admin nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()` function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account. Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two step procedure on the critical functions.',
