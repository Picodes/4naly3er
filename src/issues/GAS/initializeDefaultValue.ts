    'This is only valid for state variables, as memory ones will be taken care of by the compiler.\n\nIf a state variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address...). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas (around **3 gas** per instance).\n\nConsider removing explicit initializations for default values.\n\n*Saves 5000 gas per instance*',
