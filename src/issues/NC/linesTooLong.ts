Today's screens are much larger so it's reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over [164](https://github.com/aizatto/character-length) characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length",
